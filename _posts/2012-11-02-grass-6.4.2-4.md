Today I sorted out a little problem in compiling GRASS with OpenGL support: a
dependency was missing (`glu`).

Also, I changed a little the `grass.sh` profile script.
[rata](mailto:rikardo.horo--AT--gmail.com) asked a while ago on the AUR if it
was possible to include the `scripts` subdirectory of GRASS inside the PATH. I
did some searches; as soon as I have seen that this was already suggested on
GRASS wiki, I just added it to the PATH inside `grass.sh`.

At the moment I am compiling packages for both the architectures, will be in
the repo as soon as all the hard work is done by my CPU :)

Another quick note: some time ago a good guy (namely
[karol](mailto:karol.bkazewicz--AT--gmail.com)) offered to add `archlinuxgis`
repo to [the unofficial repos
page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unofficial_User_Repositories#Unsigned_2).
Kudos to karol!
