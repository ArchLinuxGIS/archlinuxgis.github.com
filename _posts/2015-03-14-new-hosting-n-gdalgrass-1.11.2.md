Today I finally gained access to a [Raspberry PI](http://www.raspberrypi.org/)
I sent over to [PCExtreme](https://www.pcextreme.nl/) for colocation. This
means the repository should be now online more continuatively than before.

In some time I plan to re-start maintaining packages that have been
out-of-date for too long now, compiling new versions and putting it on the
repo.

[saultdon](https://aur.archlinux.org/account/saultdon/) finally contacted me
saying that a new version of `gdal-grass` has been released, providing also
the sources needed for the upgrade. I gladly integrated them and now there
should be an updated version (1.11.2) in the binary repository, on
[github](https://github.com/ArchLinuxGIS/archlinuxgis) and (more important) on
[AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org).
